https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2019/ecse321-group-project-12/wiki/How-to-Acces-Our-My-Coop-System


## Project Scope:
We are developing a co-op software system for Ms. Lorraine Donald (MSc), Industry Liaison Associate at Faculty of Engineering. As Group 12 we are developing the company viewpoint of the 'MyCo-op System' which supports the scenarios described in the user story for the employer stakeholder, it also integrates the other stakeholders which are being developed by other teams in this development unit 2 (Students, Co-op Administrator, Academic Program Manager).
All functionality of the final system will be accessible via a web frontend for respective their stakeholders. In addition, a mobile (Android) frontend will allow them to execute the most important functionality for the given stakeholder, i.e. it shall have both read and write access to the backend via RESTful service calls.
